                    <h3>1979 - Establishment</h3>
                    <p>Kenya Marine and Fisheries research institute was established in 1979 as a result of an enactment of the Science and Technology (Amendment) Act and was charged with the responsibility of conducting research and making management recommendations essential for the national exploitation of living and non-living aquatic resources in the ocean waters, as well as the fresh water in the hinterland. Managed by a Board of Management, the institute undertook research activities in close consultation with and under the general supervision of the National Council for Science and Technology. The research programme of the Institute was then divided into two groups, namely marine and freshwater research sectors. It was noticed that in addition to the long-term established objectives of providing a scientific basis for the management of natural resources, the institute should also be prepared to respond to the rapid rising public interest in the preservation of environmental quality problems that are likely to develop in the inshore waters, including the estuaries and the areas whereby there is an increase in human activities with a likelihood of affecting the fisheries.</p>

                    <h3>Mr. Samuel Alela 1979-1990</h3>
                    <p>

On this basis, the institute embarked on expanding the training programme to provide the staff necessary skills for the institute to expand its fisheries work, oceanography, aquaculture, limnology, and environmental studies in marine and freshwater. In deciding on the expansion, it was recognized that an active programme in aquaculture especially the declining species in L. Victoria and associated rivers could not be undertaken without adequate facilities. It was therefore decided to construct the Sangoro Sub-station to carry out studies on the anadromous species of Lake Victoria.
It was also decided to equip Kisumu and Turkana Laboratories with adequate research vessels. Two vessels were purchased and one was put into service during the year. These were the 50ft. R.V. Utafiti which is based in Kisumu and a 35ft. vessel fitted with a trawl winch for Lake Turkana Laboratory. In principle, it was agreed that the institute needed an ocean-going vessel basically a stern trawler designed to have the capability for both fisheries and oceanography with laboratory facilities for scientists on board.
The Marine Sector - Mombasa
The main objective of the marine sector situated at Mombasa was to collect and consolidate all available marine fishery data resources, which provided information for development. In addition, Mombasa Laboratory undertook research programs that led to the understanding of most of the economically important species which help in the biological monitoring of their stock characteristics for proper management, conservation, and conducting exploratory and experimental surveys. With the realization of the importance of environmental factors and their effects on living resources, the Mombasa Laboratory also carried out research programs on the psycho-chemical parameters essential for the planned conservation and management.
Freshwater section - Kisumu
The freshwater section now centered at Kisumu prior to 1979 had research programs directed towards the biological studies of fishes in Lake Victoria. Little work was carried out in Lake Turkana, Lake Naivasha, and Lake Baringo.
During the past years, Kenya had witnessed the greatest dam construction for hydroelectric production. Although the resulting reservoirs have led to increased fishing activities, especially along the Tana River the effects of dams on the river ecology downstream are still not known. A riverine laboratory was established at Sangoro on river Sondu geared towards establishing breeding techniques for the most important species. After completion, the institute laboratory at Ferguson Gulf of Lake Turkana would take care of other Rift Valley lakes with Substations at lake Baringo and Naivasha.</p>

                    <p>Dr. Ezekiel Okemwa PhD 1990-2000
Dr. Ezekiel Okemwa became the Director of KMFRI after the founder Director Mr. Allela got transferred to head KIPPO in 1990. The institute continued to undertake and expand research projects under the new impetus of international and local institutional collaboration, particularly in marine research. Funding was made available through the Kenya Belgium Project (KBP) and KMFRI from European Economic Community (EEC). This new funding arrangement enabled the biological chemical and physical oceanographic projects to continue. The University of Nairobi teamed up with KMFRI on a new fishery project under the same fund. Pollution studies received fresh input when KMFRI was selected as the regional representative of the East African regional sea programme and funds were allocated for pollution studies.
Most of the projects initiated under this fresh funding were geared towards ecological studies and aimed at improving our present knowledge of the functioning of various ecosystems along the Kenyan Coast. Like in the previous year, most of the work focused on the Southern Kenyan Coast. More attention was paid to Gazi creek, where the environmental data collected would be used for ecological modeling of the creek. Kilindini and Tudor Creeksâ€™ work continued on pollution, hydrography, and seasonal variation of physical and chemical parameters.</p>
